\section{Benchmark results on \OCaml~4}

The benchmark results for \OCaml~4 are given in \cref{fig:bench4}. The
results are very close to \cref{fig:bench5}, and in particular the
qualitative analysis of the results is mostly unchanged. (We used
\texttt{ulimit -s unlimited} to disable the system stack limit, to run
the non-tail-recursive version on large lists.)
