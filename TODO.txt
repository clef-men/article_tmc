## What do we want to keep from the appendices, and where?



## Requested by the reviewers

Include the Scala paper in the related work, around the discussion of Prolog.
(And possibly a citation for Prolog, see the reference in the reviews.)

DONE

## From the author response

A change to perform:
> (On re-reading, we notice that we did not say explicitly in the submission that constructor compression is included in our mechanized soundness proof. We will clarify this in the article.)

DONE

Maybe we want to include a part of our answers on "Primary comments > review C":

- why is it interesting/important to use Simuliris for compiler verification
- what is hard about our work?

TODO


Explain better in the paper why we only measure List.map: it corresponds to the worst case.
(Point at further experiments in the OCaml community giving qualitatively similar results for other functions.)

DONE


Explain better why the transformation is opt-in.

DONE


Maybe we want to explain that it would be possible to a a three-pass
transform, first elaborating into Minamide's calculus, then exposing
Minamide's operators as mutable state, and finally removing the
unused/constant first parameter. (Maybe not.)

NOT PLANNED
